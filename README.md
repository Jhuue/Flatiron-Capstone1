# Overview

Computing Vision sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t have much background in creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office using different samples of available data. You then will translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Computing Vision's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

# Business Understanding

Computing Vision is looking to become engaged in creating video content, but are unsure how to create successful movies. In order to  analyze available data and determine market trends, there are a few important questions that must be asked:

What are the current trends in the movie industry in terms of popular film genres and film review scores?

What types of films are performing well based on overall rating, and what characteristics make them successful?

How can Computing Vision's new movie studio leverage existing data to adjust their decisions on film production?

What key risks are involved in the movie industry?

How can Computing Vision's new movie studio measure and track performance over time and what metrics should be used to evaluate performance?

# Data Understanding and Analysis

Today, data understanding and analysis are essential as they enable both individuals and businesses to make informed decisions based on existing insights. However, without a solid foundation for identifying and analysing data, misinterpreting information can lead to poor decisions and easily avoided mistakes. Using a strong understanding of the relation of data to a problem, as well as relevant details within the data, we are able to identify patterns, trends, and relationships in order to provide insight for Computing Vision's decision making going forward.

## Data Sources

The primary data used for sourcing our information will be [The Movies DB](https://github.com/Jhuue/Flatiron-Capstone1/blob/main/Data/tmdb.movies.csv).

## Data Description

This is due to the database's tracking of genre, movie name, overall rating, and number of reviews submitted for each rating. Using this information, we are able to determine popularity by analysing the number of reviews, determine reception by analysing the overall rating, and create correlations between that information and different movie genres.

## Visualizations
